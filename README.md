## Application Purpose 
The purpose of this project is to address the critical shortage of cybersecurity educators while also meeting the need for quality cybersecurity educational opportunities. By developing a platform that connects educators in need of teaching assistants (TAs) with knowledgeable cybersecurity students who are either in their final year of a bachelor's degree or attending graduate school (master’s or doctoral), the application aims to enhance the quality and accessibility of cybersecurity education nationwide. 

## Application Description
<span style="color:red">CyberSecurTA </span> connects cybersecurity students with teachers needing skilled TAs. The platform matches based on skills and availability, enhancing cyber education, and providing real-world teaching experience for students. This application will offer educators with needed classroom support while providing students who are considering a career in cybersecurity education with practical teaching experience. We’re hacking the gap and building the future workforce! **We’re hacking the gap and building the future workforce!**
